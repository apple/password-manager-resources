## Key Resources

### Password Rules
**File:** [`quirks/password-rules.json`](quirks/password-rules.json)  
**Purpose:** Generate passwords compatible with websites' requirements.  

#### How It Works:
- Domains map to [Password Rules](https://developer.apple.com/password-rules/) (e.g., `minlength: 8; required: lower, upper;`).
- Rules apply to subdomains by default. Use `"exact-domain-match-only": true` to restrict to exact domains.  

**Example Entry:**
```json
"example.com": {
  "password-rules": "minlength: 12; required: upper, numeric; allowed: ascii-printable;"
},
// example.com (2024-01-01): https://example.com/password-policy
Shared Credentials
Files:

Active: quirks/shared-credentials.json

Historical: quirks/shared-credentials-historical.json

Purpose:

Active: Suggest credentials across affiliated sites (e.g., first.website and second.website).

Historical: Suppress reuse warnings for formerly linked sites.

Change Password URLs
File: quirks/change-password-URLs.json
Purpose: Direct users to a siteâ€™s password change page.

Example Entry:

json
"example.com": "https://example.com/account/change-password"
Websites Where 2FA Code is Appended to Password
File: quirks/websites-that-append-2fa-to-password.json
Purpose: Prevent auto-submission of forms requiring 2FA codes appended to passwords.
